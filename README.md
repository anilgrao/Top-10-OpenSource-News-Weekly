# Top-10-OpenSource-News-Weekly

Will place top news from the open source world weekly. 
There can be so many news items and all cannot be placed here. Instead only top 10 items will be displayed.
Of course, these news are published by other news channeles, media outlets and so authorship goes to them in its entirely. 
This aggregation is for just information/education purpose only.
